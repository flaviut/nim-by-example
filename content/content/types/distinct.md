# Distinct Types

Distinct types are like other type aliases, but they provide type safety so that it is impossible to coerce a distinct type into its base type without explicit conversion.

``` nim
type
  Dollars* = distinct float

var a = 20.Dollars
a = 25  # Doesn't compile
a = 25.Dollars  # Works fine
```

However, when using distinct types, none of the base type's procedures follow the type. To solve this, it is possible to create lots of procedures that basically act as a thin wrapper for the underlying types, or the `{.borrow.}` pragma can be used to automate generation of procedures.

``` nim
proc `*` *(a, b: Dollars): Dollars {.borrow.}
proc `+` *(a, b: Dollars): Dollars {.borrow.}
a = 20.Dollars * 20.Dollars
```

When creating a distinct type from an object type, none of its fields are carried over. If the fields are wanted, they can be brought over through an overloading of the `{.borrow.}` pragma. If they are not borrowed, they cannot be accessed.

``` nim
type
  Foo = object
    a: int
  MyFoo {.borrow: `.`.} = distinct Foo

var value: MyFoo
echo value.a  # Works
```
